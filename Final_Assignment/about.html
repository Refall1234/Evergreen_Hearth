  <h2>About Us</h2>

  <p> Evergreen Hearth was created as a calm, welcoming space where good food and good values meet.
    We believe that what you eat should make you feel nourished, grounded, and at ease. </p>

  <p> Our menu is built around the healthiest ingredients we can responsibly source — fresh produce,
    whole foods, and thoughtfully selected proteins. We avoid shortcuts, artificial additives,
    and unnecessary processing. </p>

  <p> Fairness matters to us. That’s why we focus on fair pricing for our guests and ethical
    partnerships with farmers and suppliers. Great food should be accessible,
    honest, and made with care. </p>

  <p> Whether you’re here to unwind, connect with friends, or enjoy a quiet meal,
    Evergreen Hearth is a place to slow down and feel at home. </p>
